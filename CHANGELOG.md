## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Trustless On-Chain Commit-Reveal** — Replaced admin-controlled stake reveal with user-driven on-chain commit-reveal. Each user reveals their own prediction after the pool locks, eliminating Oracle trust for stake aggregation.
  - New `reveal_prediction()` user-callable transition — consumes a Prediction record to prove authenticity, accumulates stakes on-chain trustlessly
  - Reveal check in `collect_winnings()` — unrevealed predictions cannot claim winnings (`commitments[id] must == 0field`)
  - `reveal_window_end` column on markets table — tracks when users' reveal window expires
  - `setRevealWindowEnd()` / `getMarketsReadyForResolution()` DB functions for reveal window timing
  - New `use-reveal-prediction` React hook — fetches user's Prediction records, submits `reveal_prediction` transactions
  - Reveal Window UI in trading panel — countdown timer, reveal buttons for each prediction, transaction status
  - Reveal Window badges in market cards and featured market carousel (violet theme)
  - Three-state UI: Blind Betting → Reveal Window → Odds Revealed

### Changed
- Renamed program from `manifoldpredictionv3.aleo` to `manifoldpredictionv4.aleo`
- **Removed** `reveal_pool_stakes()` admin-only transition (centralized trust)
- **Removed** `revealPoolStakes()` from Oracle worker (no admin reveal step)
- **Removed** `REVEAL_POOL_FEE` config, `markStakesRevealed()`, `getLockedUnrevealedMarkets()`, `getLockedRevealedMarkets()` (all admin-reveal artifacts)
- Worker flow changed from `sync → create → lock → reveal → resolve` to `sync → create → lock (+ set reveal window) → resolve (after window ends)`
- `markets` table: replaced `stakes_revealed BOOLEAN` with `reveal_window_end BIGINT`
- Market conversion (`apiMarketToMarket`) now derives `oddsRevealed` and `isInRevealWindow` from `reveal_window_end` timestamp
- `Market` type gains `isInRevealWindow` and `revealWindowEnd` fields
- On-chain sync guard updated to use reveal window timing instead of `stakes_revealed` flag
- All PROGRAM_ID references updated to `manifoldpredictionv4.aleo` across frontend

### Documentation
- Updated `docs/PRIVACY_MODEL.md` — replaced admin-reveal architecture with trustless commit-reveal, added comparison table, updated pool lifecycle and security considerations

### Previous (v3): Blind Betting Foundation
- `commitments` mapping on-chain to prevent double-betting
- Oracle `predictions` table for off-chain prediction tracking
- `POST /predictions` API endpoint for frontend reporting
- Frontend shows "Blind Betting Active", hidden odds, and lock icons during betting phase
- `finalize_predict()` does not publish `amount`, `option`, or stake totals on-chain

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Transaction execution broken** - Transactions were showing "submitted" but never hitting the chain. Root causes:
  - Missing 5th input (`credits.aleo/credits` record) for the `predict` function — Aleo records are UTXOs that must be explicitly passed as inputs in the exact order the Leo function expects. Now fetched via `requestRecords('credits.aleo')`, validated for sufficient balance, and attached as the 5th input
  - `recordIndices: [4]` now passed in `TransactionOptions` to tell the wallet which input positions contain records
  - Fee too low (`0.1 ALEO`) for cross-program ZK proof execution; increased to `1.5 ALEO` (the `predict` function calls `credits.aleo/transfer_private` which requires expensive proof generation)
  - `privateFee: true` required two separate private records (one for stake, one for fee); switched to `privateFee: false` (public fee) so users only need one private record
  - Added proper record parsing that handles different wallet return formats (Leo, Puzzle, Shield, Galileo)
  - Added clear error message when user has insufficient private credits balance

### Improved
- **Market loading speed** - Markets now appear instantly from the API, with on-chain data (stakes, trader counts) enriched in the background instead of blocking the initial render
- **Loading UX** - Replaced the generic spinner with skeleton placeholder cards that match the real card layout

### Changed
- `Frontend/hooks/use-prediction.ts` - Complete rewrite of transaction submission with proper Aleo record handling per official documentation
- `Frontend/hooks/use-aleo-pools.ts` - Split into two-phase loading (API-first, then on-chain enrichment)
- `Frontend/components/market/market-card.tsx` - Added `MarketCardSkeleton` component
- `Frontend/app/page.tsx` - Uses skeleton cards during loading state
